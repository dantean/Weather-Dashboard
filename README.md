# Weather Dashboard

Created by Joseph Monticelli


## Description

A simple weather application using 3rd party weather API.

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
✅ THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
✅ THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
✅ THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
✅ THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


## How To Use

Launch index.html, type the name of a city you want to see a forecast for in the search bar. Hit 'enter' or press the button to search for the city. You will get the current weather and a 5-day forecast below that. A history of cities you've searched for will be populated underneath the search bar. You can press "clear history" to delete them and start over. 

## Future Development

Probably none, but I'll revisit this concept for a future application

## Credit Where Credit Is Due

- Instructor Phil once again, for going over 90% of how to do this in class recordings which I had to re-watch to finish this
- ChatGPT for fixing my syntax errors and helping to suggest fixes in my code whenever I broke something, and giving me sample code for the "clear history" function. 
- My nephew Giovanni, for helping to keep me motivated to push through these assignments
